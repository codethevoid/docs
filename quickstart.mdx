This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with our platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your wallet">
    Choose one of two options to get your wallet ready:
    - [Create](/wallet/create) a new wallet 
    - [Import](/wallet/import) an existing wallet
  </Step>

<Step title="Fund your wallet">
  Send a minimum of 1 XRP to your wallet. This serves as your wallet's base
  [reserve](/wallet/reserves) and is required to activate any wallet on the XRP
  Ledger. This helps prevent spam and abuse on the network.
</Step>

  <Step title="Access the decentralized exchange (DEX)">
    Once your wallet is funded:
    - Start exploring active trading pairs
    - Buy and sell tokens directly on our [DEX](/dex/overview)
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You're now ready to start trading and managing your digital assets on Motion.
