With just a few clicks, you can buy and sell assets directly on our platform.

## Transaction Components

When executing trades, you'll encounter these important values:

- **Slippage**: The difference between the expected amount of an asset you'll receive in a trade and the actual amount you get, often due to market fluctuations. It ensures you don't receive significantly less than anticipated. [Learn more](/dex/slippage)
- **Minimum received**: The minimum amount of the asset received (after slippage)
- **Network cost**: The XRPL network fee
- **Trade fee**: Our platform fee for the trade. [Learn more](/dex/fees)

## Buying assets

To buy an asset, go to the page for the asset you want to buy. You will see an order form that looks like this:

Simply enter the amount of XRP you'd like to trade for the issued token and click "Buy". A confirmation prompt will appear for you to review and approve the trade. Once confirmed, the trade will be processed, and the issued token will be added to your wallet if the transaction is successful.

## Selling assets

To sell an asset, go to the page for the asset you want to sell. Click on the **Sell** tab.
