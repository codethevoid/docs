Slippage is the difference between the expected amount of an asset you'll receive in a trade and the actual amount you get, often due to market fluctuations. Having a slippage tolerance ensures you don't receive significantly less than anticipated.

## How slippage works

If you're buying a token, let’s call it MOON, and the exchange rate is 1:1 with XRP, you’d expect to receive 100 MOON for 100 XRP.

However, due to market fluctuations, the actual amount you receive might be slightly less. This is where slippage comes in. For example, if you set your slippage tolerance to 5%, it means you're willing to accept a minimum of 95 MOON for your 100 XRP. If the trade results in less than 95 MOON, it won’t go through, ensuring you don’t lose more than you’re comfortable with.

## Adjusting slippage

You can adjust the slippage by clicking on the gear icon in the order form.
