Referring your friends and anyone you know to Motion is a great way to make money.

## How it works

When you refer a friend to Motion, and they either create or import a wallet using your referral link, you will receive 25% of their trading [fees](/dex/fees). These fees are paid in XRP.

## How to get started

Navigate to your wallet portal and click on the **Affiliate** tab.

Here you can see your total earnings as well as your referral link that you can share. Also, as a bonus, you can customize your referral link. (See below for more details)

## Customize your referral link

Either click on the image or the little pencil icon to customize your link.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/affiliate/customize-link.png"
    alt="Customize your referral link"
  />
</Frame>

A dialog will appear where you can change the title and the image of your referral link. This is optional, but it can help you get more clicks. Especially when sharing on social media.
