    Create a password for your wallet. This will be used to encrypt and decrypt
    your wallet's private keys and will allow you to sign transactions. We do
    not store your password. If lost, we cannot recover it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure your wallet">
    After creating your wallet, you will be given a 12 word mnemonic phrase. We
    recommend writing it down and storing it in a physical location.

    <Warning>
      It is crucial to keep your mnemonic phrase safe. If lost, you will lose
      all access to your wallet and any assets stored in it. Do not share this
      phrase with anyone.
    </Warning>
    Once you've written down your phrase, go to the next step and confirm it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find your wallet">
    Once you've finished creating your wallet, you will need to fund it with
    XRP.

    The XRP Ledger requires a minimum of 1 XRP to activate your wallet. This is
    called the base [reserve](/wallet/reserves). You can fund your wallet by
    sending XRP to the address shown in your wallet. [Learn more](/wallet/fund)
