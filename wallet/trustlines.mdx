Trustlines are a feature of the XRPL which lets users decide what tokens they are willing to hold. This helps users control what happens to their account. This prevents being given random tokens which someone may not want.

## View your trustlines

To view your trustlines, go to the **Trustlines** tab within the wallet overview.

Here, you can view all the trustlines you have set up, along with the balance for each token. For example, in the image above, the user has a trustline limit of 100 billion RLUSD and a current balance of 1.056 RLUSD.

## Adding a trustline

When you interact with a token on our DEX, you don’t need to worry about setting up a trustline. We’ll automatically handle it for you when you decide to buy a token.

## Updating a trustline limit

To update a trustline, click on the trustline you want to update, and a prompt will appear.

You can now adjust the trustline limit, but if you hold a balance of the asset, the new limit cannot be set lower than your current balance.

## Removing a trustline

You can remove a trustline by setting the limit to 0.

Keep in mind, your balance of the asset will have to be 0 before you can remove a trustline. For example, if you have 100 RLUSD, you will need to either sell or transfer the RLUSD to another wallet before you can remove the trustline.
