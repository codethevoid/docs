## How It Works

Your wallet serves as your gateway to the XRP Ledger, allowing you to:

- Send and receive XRP and issued tokens
- Manage token trustlines
- Monitor real-time balances
- View transaction history
- Connect directly to the DEX

## Security First

We've built Motion with security at its core. Your private keys stay safely in your control, protected by military-grade (AES-256) encryption at rest.
