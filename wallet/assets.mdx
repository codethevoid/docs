Managing assets such as XRP and other issued tokens is a key feature of your wallet. Our goal is to simplify the process of storing, sending, and receiving your assets while providing real-time tracking of their value.

## Viewing balances

You can view your balances by navigating to the wallet portal.

When you access the wallet portal, you'll see your wallet address and the total value of your wallet in USD at a glance. You can also view the balance and USD value of each individual asset. For more in-depth information, simply click on any asset to explore its details.

## Sending assets

To send an asset, you can navigate to the **Send** tab in the wallet portal.

Sending assets is a straightforward process. There a few fields you need to fill out:

- **Destination**: The address you want to send the asset to.
- **Asset**: The asset you want to send.
- **Amount**: The amount of the asset you want to send.
- **Destination tag**: This is often confused with a memo. It is sometimes required by the destination address, especially by centralized exchanges.
- **Memo**: A note to include with the transaction.

## Receiving assets

To recieve assets, you can navigate to the **Receive** tab in the wallet portal.
