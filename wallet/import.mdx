If you already have a wallet, you can import it into Motion. This will allow you to manage your existing wallet and assets within the Motion platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your password">
    Navigate to [Motion.zip](https://motion.zip) and click on the __"Connect"__
    button in the top right corner.

    Create a password for your wallet. This will be used to encrypt and decrypt
    your wallet's private keys and will allow you to sign transactions. We do
    not store your password. If lost, we cannot recover it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select import method">
    You can import your wallet from your family seed or a mnemonic phrase.
